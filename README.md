**hi there!**

welcome to <br>**`ibov prediction api_ :mage:`**</br>a small project to practice deploying models, exploring a time series forecasting with the bovespa index.

---

**what it does**  
using an **arima** model, it predicts future values of the **ibov** based on historical data pulled from yahoo finance. <br><br> 
the backend runs on **fastapi**, with simple **jinja2** html pages for interaction and **statsmodels** for the forecasting.

you can:
- 🛠️ train the model with your chosen date ranges
- 📈 predict ibov values for 1 or more days ahead
